# Transaction Pattern Detection

This project processes transaction data in chunks from Google Drive, uploads to AWS S3, and detects patterns using PySpark on Databricks.

- **Mechanism X:** Reads 10,000 transactions every second and uploads to S3.
- **Mechanism Y:** Reads chunks from S3, detects patterns, and writes results back to S3.

## Patterns

- Customers to UPGRADE
- Customers marked as CHILD
- Merchants needing DEI

## How to run

1. Set up AWS S3 and PostgreSQL.
2. Place input files in Google Drive.
3. Run Mechanism X and Y on Databricks or VS Code
